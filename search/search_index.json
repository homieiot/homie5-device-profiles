Where the Homie Convention provides a standardized way for device discovery, descriptions, and value/event update publishing, the profiles defined here will add meaning to those devices, nodes and properties published. When using the Homie Convention to describe a light-bulb for example, there are many ways in which this can be done; a single property power : 0-100% a single property brightness : 0-255 a boolean power property and a brightness property 0-100% Now how is a Homie controller to know all of the possible different implementations? Hence we define a profile with a unique name and publish it along with the device description. The official Homie Profiles are documented in this project. Goals provide a unambiguous representation of the state a device is in provide a strict expectation for the user how a device behaves make it easy to discover compatible devices/capabilities allow flexibility in having required/optional/custom elements provide hints for a UI, without specifying the UI implementation Types of profiles Profiles are defined on 2 levels; Capability level: this maps to a Homie \"node\" within a device, and it defines the properties for the capability/node. Device level: this maps to the Homie device, and it defines the capabilities for the device This structure allows for reuse of Capability profiles across different Device profiles Capability profiles Capability profiles are defined on a node level. Each node represents a certain capability a device posesses which provides state or functionality via its properties. A Capability profile specifies the following: required properties; eg. a Dimmer MUST have a \"brightness\" property optional properties; eg. a Dimmer MAY have a \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" property node/capability behaviour across properties to make behaviour unambiguous. For example: if either \"minimum\" or \"maximum\" is provided, the other MUST also be provided If \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" are provided, then the actual value sent to the device will be the \"brightness\" value mapped to the range between \"minimum\" and \"maximum\". Note: Capabilities MAY have additional properties, unless specified otherwise. Each node represents an instantiation of a capability. There can be more than one of the same capability on a device (e.g. 2 button capability nodes for a wall switch with 2 buttons) Device profiles A device profile specifies the following: required capabilities; eg. a Light MUST have a \"switch\" capability optional capabilities; eg. a Light MAY have a \"dimmer\" capability device/node/property behaviour across capabilities to make behaviour unambiguous. For example: If a device has a \"color\" capability, then it MUST also have a \"dimmer\" capability Changing the \"dimmer\" state MUST NOT change the \"switch\" state Note: devices MAY have additional Capabilities and/or Nodes, unless specified otherwise. Advertizing The way the profile is announced is 2 fold. It is advertized using a Homie MQTT topic, as well as in the JSON description document. The components of the profile consist of the profile name, as well as the supported version (major+minor). Capability advertizing The node level attribute where to publish the profile in use is: $profile . The topic will have the name and the major version number, where the value contains the minor version number; homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/[profile]/[maj] \u2192 \"[min]\" The device description JSON document, in the node-object; { ..., \"$profile\": [\"[profile]/[maj]/[min]\"], ... } Note : in the JSON document the $profile property holds an array value, not a single string. See versioning below. So for a homie-sensor-temperature , version 1.3 , documented as homie-sensor-temperature/1/3 the capability would be advertized as: homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/1 \u2192 \"3\" { ..., \"$profile\": [\"homie-sensor-temperature/1/3\"], ... } Capability searching For controllers looking to find a specific type of device they are compatible with, they can use the published MQTT topic to query for the specific capabilities. For example: Topic subscription result homie/5/*/*/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/* Will return all homie-sensor-temperature capabilities homie/5/mydevice/*/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/* Will return all homie-sensor-temperature capabilities of device mydevice homie/5/*/*/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/2 Will return all homie-sensor-temperature capabilities compatible with version 2 By parsing the returned topics and values, all relevant data can be extracted: device id node id supported capability major version supported capability minor version Versioning Versioning is based on SemVer and is only done using the major and minor version components. This is because the profiles are description documents describing features and functionality. Any patch update would only be a clarification, never a change. Hence it does not make sense to advertize or search for versions including a patch version. Since minor versions are backward compatible within a major version, there is no need to ever list multiple minor versions. A device should only advertize the latest minor version it is compatible with. Eg. if a device advertizes version 1.2 , it is implicit that it also supports versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the same profile. If a device or a node supports either multiple profiles, or supports multiple major versions of a profile, then they can all be advertized. Here's an example of a capability supporting 2 profiles, and one of them in 2 versions: homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/1 \u2192 \"2\" homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/2 \u2192 \"0\" homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/power-switch/1 \u2192 \"3\" { ..., \"$profile\": [ \"homie-sensor-temperature/1/2\", \"homie-sensor-temperature/2/0\", \"power-switch/1/3\" ], ... } So overall profile support in this example is: homie-sensor-temperature , versions 1.0 to 1.2 , and 2.0 power-switch , versions 1.0 to 1.3 Note : to be able to use multiple profiles it is essential that there are no naming collissions between the properties used in each of the profiles.","title":"Introduction to Homie Profiles"},{"location":"#introduction-to-homie-profiles","text":"","title":"Introduction to Homie Profiles"},{"location":"#abstract","text":"This document aims to list a set of predefined device and capability profiles to be used in IoT and home automation scenarios.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Action introduction An action is something that happens relative to the state of a device. What does that mean? Most of the homie convention is based on \"state\" that lives as 'retained' values on the MQTT bus. Interaction is done by modifying that state. For example a dimmer; pass 30 to the set attribute of the property that holds the curent state. This will set the absolute value of that dimmer to 30% . pass 100 to the set attribute of the property that holds the curent state. This will set the absolute value of that dimmer to 100% . However, not all interactions can be modeled that way. For example if we want to 'step-up' or 'step-down' the dimmer value. In either case the new state value will be relative to the previous state. For cases like this the action capability can be used. Caution : the preferred way with Homie devices is to use state-based controls. Only use actions if there is no way to do it state-based. For example don't use actions on , off , and toggle , but model on / off as state, and only toggle as an action. Devices vs Nodes The actions typically apply to nodes. Hence the capability-profiles list the actions available for a node. However the action-node is usually implemented on a Device level. This allows the action to have a wider scope and be used for multiple nodes. For example a level capability has 2 actions; step-up and step-down . And a power-switch has a toggle action. So a homie-light-dimmable device gets all three actions; step-up , step-down , and toggle . The step-up and step-down actions act on the brightness node, while the toggle action acts on the power node. Devices can define additional actions not bound to a specific node. Additionally a device MAY rename actions in case of naming colissions. Examples A Homie device with 1 node as an action. Example This minimal example only implements the required properties.

Description A numerical sensor is a sensor for any numerical type data, eg. speed, temperature, volume etc. The type is not further specified, because it can be set using the regular unit attribute on the value. In a similar way the limits and precision can be specified using the format property. The most basic implementation will only have a value property. There are more advanced options that support calibration, and virtual sensors of this type. Specifically typed sensors are available for the most common formats. Each with their own profile name and version.

This allows for creating Homie sensors from any MQTT topic in the system.

For most electrical switches this value is 0 , indicating it switches instantaneously. For a valve however this will not be the case. A motorized valve for water or gas for example typically has a run time of several minutes to completely open. If this is set then a set command to change the state will delay updating the actual value by this time. This behaviour can be made more specific by the optional enable-time and disable-time properties. If they are not present, then the switch-time will be used for both enable-time and disable-time . Consider an underfloor water based heating system with thermal valves. The valves will take 3 minutes to completely open. If a heat request is send to the boiler immediately after switching the value to true , the pump will go into an error state because it fails to pump the water through the system as the valve is only just starting to open up. By setting this value to 180 seconds, the time needed to open the valve completely, this can be prevented. After setting the value property to true , the device will wait 180 seconds before it will actually set the value of the value property to true . (the target attribute will be updated immediately, if present, to indicate the state change is in progress). Because the switch might change state again before reaching the end-state, the device will need to keep track of time spend enabling/disabling to detect where it exactly is. If the enable-time property is available, then the delay between receiving the set=true command and reporting the true state will be the time specified in enable-time . If the device was not entirely in the disabled state, then the current state should be taken into account. If the disable-time property is available, then the delay between receiving the set=false command and reporting the false state will be the time specified in disable-time . If the device was not entirely in the enabled state, then the current state should be taken into account.

Device capabilities id type optional comment switch homie-capability-profile/v1/type=switch no n.a. dimmer homie-capability-profile/v1/type=dimmer yes n.a The id is the required name on the Homie \"Node\" level Inter-capability behaviour The switch has no effect on the dimmer state, nor the dimmer state on the switch. Examples: state action result remark switch.state=true, dimmer.brightness=50 set switch.state=false switch.state=false, dimmer.brightness=50 brightness is unchanged switch.state=false, dimmer.brightness=50 set dimmer.brightness=60 switch.state=false, dimmer.brightness=60 light remains off Capability descriptions Switch type : \"homie-capability-profile/v1/type=switch\" Example usages : Represent a switchable actor, e.g. wall socket plug, light bulb. Properties id type settable (default) retained unit format comment state boolean yes yes - off,on format specifies labels for false/true action enum yes no - toggle toggles state between true and false Comments: Since a boolean does not carry any context, the format property specifies the labels for the boolean values. The format is the same as an enum where false is the first and true is the second entry. Reasoning is that if the enum is an array , and false is often represented as 0 and true often as 1. Then those 0/1 values are the indices of the format array to ease implementations. This format entry requires a change to the Homie protocol The value could also be specified as an enum all together, but having a boolean provides a hint to a UI as to how to render the property (see the \"goals\" section\"). Dimmer type : \"homie-capability-profile/v1/type=dimmer\" Example usages : Dimmable light. Properties id type settable (default) retained unit format comment brightness integer yes yes % 1:100 0 is not allowed since it would be ambiguous action enum yes no - brighter,darker Comments: brightness is restricted from 1 to 100%, 0 would be ambiguous. It is important to note that this is the STATE representation, not the UI representation. A UI is still free in how it renders the state; a single slider 0-100, a switch and 1-100, or a switch and 0-100. The brighter and darker actions are problematic in so far as that we would need to define the delta adjustment value. But depending on the devices practical values could be difficult to align. An argument could be made to completly remove this feature all together but it has proved to be rather practical in home automation scenarios. Another way could be a 'delta' property that simply receives +- values for adjustments.

Then those 0/1 values are the indices of the format array to ease implementations.
